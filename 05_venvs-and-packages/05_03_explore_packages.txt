Do an online search for interesting Python packages on PyPI.
You can search for something you're interested to do with your programming
skills and add "Python package" to the search query.
- What do you find?
- Create a new virtual environment and install the package.
- Check out its documentation and their "Getting Started" guide
  and code examples, if there are any.
- Can you get some basic functionality of the package to work locally?


Tried out loguru. Following is logurutest.py:
---
# Loguru Test

from loguru import logger

logger.debug("Hello, cool debugger")
---
Then command 'python3 logurutext.py' ran in the (venv) CLI gave output:
"2021-11-17 22:34:52.899 | DEBUG    | __main__:<module>:5 - Hello, cool debugger"

I have no idea what this means, but it seems to work.
