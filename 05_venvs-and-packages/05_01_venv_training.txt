Create a new folder. Inside of that folder:
1. Create a new Python virtual environment
2. Activate the virtual environment
3. Install three external packages in the virtual environment.
4. Freeze the installed packages to a `requirements.txt` file.
5. Deactivate the virtual environment.
6. Delete the virtual environment.
7. Create a new virtual environment.
8. Install the packages that you recorded in the `requirements.txt` file.


Solution:

(3) mypy, loguru, pyright
(4) pip freeze -l > requirements.txt
(8) https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html
	In particular:
	python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
Where requirements.txt is inside the venv folder AND we are in (venv) in the CLI.

Purpose of this task:

Can send this requirements.txt to someone else who wants to work on the same project as you (e.g. via Github)
